# SensorWebView

This web viewer can be used to call a web processing service to generate heat
map layers which are derived from sensor data and display them in a web map.
The generated maps can be tweaked by the user using the provided user interface
for defining kernel density weighting and target dates.

# Installation

This software is designed to be run as a Tomcat webapp. To install, simply clone
this repository in the Tomcat webapp directory and restart Tomcat. The
application should then be available under `localhost/sensorWebApp`.

The map overlay is generated by a local GeoServer instance with the WPS (Web
Processing Service) extension installed. For further information, see the 
[Tomcat 7](https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-7.0-doc/appdev/installation.html), 
[GeoServer](http://docs.geoserver.org/stable/en/user/installation/index.html#installation)
and
[WPS](http://docs.geoserver.org/maintain/en/user/extensions/wps/install.html)
installation guides.

This software was tested successfully using the combination `Tomcat 7`,
`GeoServer 2.8.3` and Java JDK `openjdk version 1.8.0_91`.
